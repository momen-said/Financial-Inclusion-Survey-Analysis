# Financial Inclusion Survey Analysis

## Background:
the world is facing unequality in the availability of the banking services in many regions and countries, this is because of many reasons, mainly poverty, untrust, safety, ...etc.

here i made an analysis on a dataset to investigate the financial inclusion abroad.

## Data Preparation:
first, the data was obtained from https://hub.festman.io/ which is an excel sheet.

then i started to prepare the data for the analysis process by cleaning it and calculating some new columns, in this process i used some important excel functions, like 
VLOOKUP,COUNTIF, SUBSTITUTE, TEXTJOIN, ... 

the cleaning process transformed the sheet to be a table with the needed columns and values for the analysis process, where it had columns about (countries, regions, gender, age, education level, income class) and other columns for the ownership of bank accounts and reasons for not owning them.





a new project I've done using #excel and #powerBI about bank accounts globally
the data was obtained from FestMan™ Learning Hub and it contains a sample of the population of each country across the world
the main results obtained from the analysis are:
- 63% of the persons have bank accounts, the percentage increases in the high income countries to 95% and decreases to 45% in the low income ones "mostly Latin American, sub-Saharan, and south Asian countries"
- most bank account owners are between 15 and 40 years
- most of them are in the workforce and completed their secondary education (most of the Asian countries owners actually completed their primary study)
- bank account female owners percentage decrease in MENA countries
- the main reasons for not having a bank account is "lack of money" and "lacking documentation papers" and also banking services are far in the low income countries
-71% have debit cards, but the percentage decreases in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and MENA region to nearly 30%
- 82% are mobile owners, most of the owners have completed their tertiary education, and most of them are between 15 and 50 years
- surprisingly, sub-Saharan Africans have the highest "mobile money account" percentage, especially countries on the east African coast (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, … etc.)
- in sub-Saharan Africa region, the percentage of mobile owners can vary from 90% in east African countries to 30% in a country like south Sudan
in conclusion, we can say that some parts in the world need to be more covered with the banking services, and also we can say sub-Saharan Africa can be an excellent new market for the banking sector globally to expand in
